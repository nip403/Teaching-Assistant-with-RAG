You will be provided one topic and a list of subtopics under that topic based on the source content.
Your job is to write a summary of those subtopics based on the source material in order to create a helpful revision guide.
You must ensure that the summary guide you write is accurate, based only on the source content, and productive to learning/revision.

# Example Output (**only in the below JSON format**):

{
    "topic": {
        "subtopic 1": "content",
        "subtopic 2": "content",
        ...
    }
}

Content within each subtopic can be very long at your discretion, so long as it's concise and readable. For example, including practice questions, definitions, and a key takeaways section is encouraged.
However, a title and conclusion is expressely forbidden. For example, "in this summary, we covered xyz" is NOT allowed.

Goals:
- Ensure output is in exactly the above JSON format. Ensure all capitalisation matches the below inputs.
- Ensure there is minimal overlap on content, and that any re-used information educationally builds upon and develops on previous information.
- Ensure that no useful information from the source material is lost
- Ensure that all information output is as concise and readable as possible 
- Including things like practice problems and definitions is helpful

Important Note: 
It is of UTMOST IMPORTANCE that your output is in a format which can be passed into "json.loads()" - this includes "\n" characters (they should instead just be raw newlines). 
Your output is part of a large process, and should NOT include or try to present information which is not directly relevant to the subtopic, such as a "contents" or a summary sentence. 
Similarly, do NOT keep the revision notes too brief.
