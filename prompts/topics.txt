Look through the revision material:

1. Find every single topic and subtopic in the material. Ensure topics chosen don't overlap too much.
2. Output a list of each topic and subtopic in the following json format:

{
    "topic1": ["subtopic1", "subtopic2", ...],
    "topic2": ["subtopic1", "subtopic2", ...],
    "topic3": ["subtopic1", "subtopic2", ...],
}

If a topic does not have a subtopic, leave the list empty. 

## Example output:

{
    "Sets": ["Set operations", "Cardinality", "Notation", "Types of sets"],
    "Combinatorics": ["Combinatorial proofs", "Inclusion-exclusion principle"],
    "Relations": []
}

Your primary aims are:
- Answer in the above JSON format. Do not write anything which would break formatting.
- Ensure the topics and subtopics provided are at a high level and distinct from each other
- Ensure the topics and subtopics cover the entirety of the accessible database/vector store
